The purpose of this project seems to be now that I can dick around in Lisp-environment using Nokolisp-editor and easily produce errorfree python code.

Has python-like primitives like "return", which is (throw return) and the lambda has the (catch return).  

Slightly dissappointed with Python, once again. It does no work as advertized. Function within function is supposed to inherit locals(), but it does not always happen. This seems to be quite random.

At the end of nokolis.py are examples of generated python code. Some issues
remaining about True and False, T and NIL.
